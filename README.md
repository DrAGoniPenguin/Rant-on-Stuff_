Unpopular Rant on Politics, Eco, Religion, Games, People, ect. from my perspective

Originally to perform catharsis on myself, but figured might as well make this a public thingie if wanted.

Just follow hausemaster's formatting for politics and **plz** add proper grammar.

note: not designed specifically for mc, can be about **anything** if it is something that relieves you or angers you.
would personally like to make it more focused on real world stuff and not games, but hey, do what you want.
