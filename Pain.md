### Unpopular Rant

**Note: No hate intended to any groups, this is just an observation and analysis on the world so far.**


##### Politics
Why do people so support leftism or rightism or Republicanism or Democratism? I honestly do not give two dead skin mousepads over your rotten homework paper. 
They seem to just slander each other on msn and stuff like that so often that it's hella annoying now. The fact that you blame Trump or Biden or Putin or Mussolini or Hitler or Stalin is kinda weird and repetitive.
-+ At least Trump did **something** even though it was kinda risky and weird. That doesn't mean I support Trump however. This is just an observation...

Presidents and politicians of differing parties seem to spend the first three years undoing **everything** that the previous party did and then spend the last year procrastinating, pushing everything onto the next president, trying to get unrelated things done and not leaving any documentation for the next generation, and/or pretending they did something. 
Literally Trump and then Biden spent most of their term so far just undoing Obama Care and Trump Care (respectively) and then proceeding to stuff as many senators, representatives, and judges into office as possible that support them. 

*Though Trump is kinda based ngl and giga for just bullying China's "Great Leader". Then again, he appears to support North Korea and stuff or at least what I'm getting from all these news groups where authors are biased to oblivion and slander opposing party news groups and political leaders.*


That Pelosi girl is just trying to grab attention at this point in my misguided youth based irrational stupid mind. Everyone seems to just be trying to make themselves money (looking at you Trump about Ivana and your golf addiction) and get famous and then leave all the problems of the next group or generation.


+- Continued, (HausemasterIssue Perspective) People support one or both of these political parties because they are groups. As humans we feel a need to be apart of something bigger, a group. If a group is appealing to us, or displays our beliefs, we are likely to support it. Now, the reason it is so divided is because our monkey brains view outsiders of our group as enemies. It's like a few guys from a different tribe with spears and stones try and tell your tribe what to do. This is pretty much politics. There is a bias called outsider bias. Where one may ignore or treat an outsider of their group with less respect or trust, this is natural. If somebody was to support leftism (you should research what it really means; Ryan Chapman on YouTube, he does a great job of this), and a rightist person was to try and pass a right-leaning law, the law may make sense, but to a leftist they are an outsider, so we treat them with less respect and trust, hating them and the law. What really adds fuel to the fire is that both ideologies refuse to find common ground because of how different they are. I'm not saying it's impossible, it's just hard. So to answer you question, as humans we feel the need to be apart of a group, if a group is appealing, we may join it. A lot of groups can hate each other due to outsider bias (racism in some situations).


##### Gender
Why do people care so much about being trans, gay, lesbian, or something. Like ok fine, you're LGBTQ or osmething, and no one cares. That doesnt mean you deserve more rights or whatever and we are all human. Sure, we might treat you differently, and that might be wrong, but I don't care man.
-+ I don't care if you're black or white or yellow or orange or red or blonde or German or Canadian or Mexican or Spanish or Russian or Scandinavian or something.  Why do you think you're so special and deserve the right to say everything is racist and  illegal or a violation of your "rights." Y'all just wasting newspaper space at this point.


##### Extremism
Do I really have to explain this?
Extremists suck short stubby teletubby doo doo hair on a pinata stick doing headstands with a Chinese RC car on a lump of Moon Cheese with square whole wheat crackers.
I recognize that PETA wants to make a difference and seriously
I won't even dicuss terrorism groups (as of the moment) because self-explanatory.
