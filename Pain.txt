1.) Why do people so support leftism or rightism or Republicanism or Democratism? I honestly do not have two dead skin mousepads over your rotten homework paper.

2.) Why do people care so much about being trans, gay, lesbian, or something. Like ok fine, you're LGBTQ or osmething, and no one cares. That doesnt mean you deserve more rights or whatever and we are all human. Sure, we might treat you differently, and that might be wrong, but I don't care man.
