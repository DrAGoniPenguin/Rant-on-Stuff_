1.) Why do people so support leftism or rightism or Republicanism or Democratism? I honestly do not have two dead skin mousepads over your rotten homework paper.

1. Continued, HausemasterIssue Perspective) People support one or both of these political parties because they are groups. As humans we feel a need to be apart of something bigger, a group. If a group is appealing to us, or displays our beliefs, we are likely to support it. Now, they reason it is so divided is because our monkey brains view outsiders of our group as enemies. It's like a few guys from a different tribe with spears and stones try and tell your tribe what to do. This is pretty much politics. There is a bias called outsider bias. Where one may ignore or treat an outsider of their group with less respect or trust, this is natural. If somebody was to support leftism (you should reesearch what it really means Ryan Chapman on YouTube does a great job of this), and a rightist person was to try and pass a right-leaning law, the law may make sense, but to a leftist they are an outsider, so we treat them with less respect and trust, hating them and the law. What really adds fuel to the fire is that both ideologies refuse to find common ground because of how different they are. I'm not saying it's impossible, it's just hard. So to answer you question, as humans we feel the need to be apart of a group, if a group is appealing, we may join it. A lot of groups can hate each other due to outsider bias (racism in some situations).
