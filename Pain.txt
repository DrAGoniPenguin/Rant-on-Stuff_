1.) Why do people so support leftism or rightism or Republicanism or Democratism? I honestly do not have two dead skin mousepads over your rotten homework paper.

2.) Why do people care so much about being trans, gay, lesbian, or something. Like ok fine, you're LGBTQ or osmething, and no one cares. That doesnt mean you deserve more rights or whatever and we are all human. Sure, we might treat you differently, and that might be wrong, but I don't care man.
-+ I don't care if you're black or white or yellow or orange or red or blonde or German or Canadian or Mexican or Spanish or Russian or Scandinavian or something.  Why do you think you're so special and deserve the right to say everything is racist and  illegal or a violation of your "rights." Y'all just wasting newspaper space at this point.
